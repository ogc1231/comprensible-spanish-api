# COMPREHENSIBLE SPANISH RESOURCES DJANGO REST FRAMWEORK API

This Django REST Framework API which works with the [FRONTEND](https://github.com/ogc1231/comprehensible-spanish-frontend) to create the Comprehensible Spanish Resources website. A user curated directory of Spanish Language resources to suit your needs whatever your level. The aim of this website to is provide a place where Spanish learners can find Comprehensible Spanish content that suits their needs whatever their level with resources ranging from those specifically designed for beginners to Advanced Native content all in one place. The advantage of this website is that users can upload resources which they have found useful and share them with other learners. The resources can also be filtered by dialect so users can hear the different accents of 20 different Spanish speaking countries, Puerto Rico & The Canary Islands.

The objective of this project was to create a DJANGO REST FRAMWEORK API whos data is consumed by Front-End application made with REACT.js.

## Features

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project,
and describe each in a sentence or so.

You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user,
focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve,
and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

IMPORTANT: Remember to always include a screenshot of each individual feature!

## Database Design

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help to visualize database architecture before creating models.
Understanding the relationships between different tables can save time later in the project.

- [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) was used to create the Entity Relationship Diagram

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/ogc1231/comprensible-spanish-api/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project.
It isn't a specialized tool, but with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments, it can be made to work.

Through it, user stories, issues, and milestone tasks were planned, then tracked on a weekly basis using the basic Kanban board.

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ogc1231/comprensible-spanish-api/issues) served as an another Agile tool.
There, I used my own **User Story Template** to manage user stories.

It also helped with milestone iterations on a weekly basis.

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into stories prior to prioritizing and implementing them.
Using this approach, I was able to apply the MoSCow prioritization and labels to my user stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration


### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | user's own value |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` | user's own value |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | user's own value |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` | user's own value |
| `USE_AWS` | True |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.
- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:
- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:
- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:
- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASS", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:
- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

If you'd like to backup your database models, use the following command for each model you'd like to create a fixture for:
- `python3 manage.py dumpdata your-model > your-model.json`
- *repeat this action for each model you wish to backup*

#### Cloning

The list below is by no means exhaustive. Within the Code Institute Slack community, you can find more "free media" links
by sending yourself the following command: `!freemedia`.
